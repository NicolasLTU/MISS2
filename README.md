# Software for the Meridian Imaging Svalbard Spectrograph 2 (KHO/UNIS)
This repository will contain all various components and the software for the new Meridian Imaging Svalbard Spectrograph 2. 
The intention is to gather all necessary tools for the smooth control of the MISS2 from image capture to image processing (RGB composite images, keogram update, spectrogram analysis...)

MISS2 (software/hardware) is directly adapted from [MISS](https://kho.unis.no/Instruments/MISS.html), a spectrograph operational since 2019 at the [Kjell Henriksen Observatory](https://kho.unis.no/), which is operated by the [University Centre In Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/).
